Maggie Del Re

Hello Ford, 
I hope you're doing well!
I'm an environmental studies major and a triple minor in English, legal sudies, 
and climate justice, science, and policy. I'm a senior anticipating graduating 
this May, which I am very excited for.
I'm not sure what I am going to do after graduation, but I know I want to stay 
broadly within the field of environmental work, and I am particularly interested 
in outdoor education, sustainable agriculture, and research - which is a big 
chunk of why this course was so appealing to me!
I'm interested in knowing a tiny bit about computer science and statistics because 
they seem increasingly practical and important as technology becomes more and 
more integrated with everyday life.
For fun, I love to listen to and play music! I listen to a wide variety, but 
my favorite genres tend to be punk and hip-hop. I play guitar as my main instrument, 
but I also sing and dabble in drums, bass, and keyboard. Tunes have been on my 
mind as of late because after ~6 years of writing and releasing songs online,
I've got my foot in the door with some folks in the Lowell college music scene, 
so I'll be recording in an actual studio with an actual sound engineer for the 
first time ever next weekend, and for the first time since pre-covid, I have 
other musicians who want to collaborate - we have some gigs on the calendar :)
Otherwise, I love to run, hike, travel, and spend time with my friends.
Looking forward to working with your this semester and hoping to get to know you 
a bit better too soon!
