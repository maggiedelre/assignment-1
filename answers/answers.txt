1.) mkdir answers

2.) nano answers.txt

4.) ~/github/assignment-1/answers

5.) ls -a

6.) ls / (you would put the path of the directory that you want ls to list/
display, regardless of whether it is in your current working directory or not)

7.) rm is a dangerous command because unlike when you delete things using GUI,
and the data goes to the recycling bin, when you use the rm command, the file is 
"removed" irreversibly, meaning it is deleted and cannot be recovered. 
This could lead to unintended consequences if you accidentally delete the wrong 
file. 
For example, if I spent all of this time typing out my answers to the questions 
in assignment-1, and then I accidentally deleted this .txt file using rm,
I would be pretty bummed that I have to re-do everything!
Using rm -i can help prevent issues like this because it makes git confirm with
you before deleting anything.

nano my_script.sh

10.) chmod 755 my_script.sh

14.) mkdir unzipped-files/
mv *.zip unzipped-files/
unzip "*.zip"

15.) rm -i *.zip

16.) cp annual_aqi_by_county_20* ~/assignment-1/answers/results
